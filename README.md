# ezMethods v0.0.2
**This adds some methods to c++ that normally would take extra lines to make and use, like split() and delay()!**

>This adds several different commands, such as..
- ezSplit(string s, string delimiter) - splits a string into a vector using the specified delimiter
- ezDelay(int milliseconds) - a simplier and easier way to delay a string, based off of lua
- ezRandom(int minimum, int maximum) - gets a random number that is within the range `minimum` and `maximum`
- ez
